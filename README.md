# perch_templates
Templates for use with PerchCMS
--------------------

#Instructions
Like any template used in Perch/Runway you just need to add any of these to your `perch/templates/content` folder then use them in any of your other templates as includes.

##example
`<perch:template path="content/calendar/months.html" />`
This will add a "Select" dropdown in the UI of "Months"

#Notes
In the coming days I will also be adding "Forms" templates which will allow your website visitors the same "Select" options.
